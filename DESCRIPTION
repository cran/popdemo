Description: Tools for modelling populations and demography using matrix projection models,
 with deterministic and stochastic model implementations. Includes population projection,
 indices of short- and long-term population size and growth, perturbation analysis,
 convergence to stability or stationarity, and diagnostic and manipulation tools.
